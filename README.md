# jonathan-lam-website
The home of the static part of Jonathan Lam's personal website

See it at https://lambdalambda.ninja

This originally started as a very simple (and ugly) static webpage, but after
moving it to GitHub it somehow turned into a whole mini build-system. This
is probably akin to a very lightweight and low-featured version of Jekyll. More
documentation to come later.
