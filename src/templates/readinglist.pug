    h2 Reading List
    p I.e., the list of "seems like it'll be useful but I'll probably be too busy to ever get around to reading these for real." Some of these are books I own.

    ul
        li SICP (Wizard Book)
        li Dragon Book
        li FreeBSD Handbook
        li R6RS or R7RS
        li RE4B
        li CP
        li Modern Operating Systems, 2nd Edition (not modern anymore, but I have a hardcopy)
        li Algorithm Design (I should've read a book like this a long time ago)
        li Algebra for Applications (wow a math book made it on this list)
        li TAOCP (long-term goal)

    hr
