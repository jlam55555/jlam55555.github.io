  p Hi! I work on the Core Markets Team at #[a(href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/" target="_blank") HRT]. This means we care a lot about correctness and speed (in that order). We work a lot with Linux and fuss over computer architecture.
  p In the past few years I've mostly been interested in low-level performance work, programming language theory (PLT), and programming education. Before that, I used to do a lot of freelance web development work. I am also a #[a(href="/res/sharon.jpg" target="_blank") cat person] who likes Studio Ghibli, and a hoarder of #[a(href="/faq#hobbies" target="_blank") rarish hobbies].
