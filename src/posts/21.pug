	p I think these plots for Typeracer scores (generated by the Discord bot) are pretty cool. I achieved a maximum of 101wpm 10-race average, and finished with a 98wpm 10-race average. I have been gotten at not quitting races prematurely. There was some practice on Keybr.com, MonkeyType.com, and Typing.com, but not much.

	p Some things I've noticed:
	ul
		li I have completely lost my ability to touch type on Qwerty. I think I'll practice this so I can use other people's keyboards again once I reach a desirable speed on Colemak.
		li I only use my left thumb for space, while it seems that a majority of users use their dominant hand thumb (except when gaming (which I don't do) and using the mouse with their dominant hand). (I am right-handed.)
		li I can type a little faster on my laptop keyboard than on the Periboard 512 keyboard I bought. The keyboard is smaller and the keypress is lighter, and I am more used to it. (I also don't like loud typing, so this may subconsciously slow me down on the relatively loud Periboard.)
		li I've been trying to learn to use Caps Lock for backspace (this is a default Colemak mapping) so that my hands don't move that much when deleting a character. It's gotten somewhat comfortable but the repeat speed is atrocious. Also, I sometimes hit Tab or Shift by accident, which is not desirable. The Caps Lock key on my laptop is broken, however, so I only use regular backspace there.
		li I've heard from other typists that they only use one Shift key (mostly left) for all capital letters. I do find this sometimes helpful for all uppercase letters (e.g., I type "TODO" a lot, which is not comfortable to type when switching Shifts), but it is still a little awkward for keys that I would normally press with my left pinky (i.e., capital Q, A, and Z). I'm not sure if I'll stick with alternating Shifts or not.
		li I have to look at the keys still when accessing many of the punctuation/number keys, which is not good.
