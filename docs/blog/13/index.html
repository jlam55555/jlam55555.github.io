I use it for most of my computer fonts<sup id="footnote-1-indicator"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">website</a> is an example to all websites. I really love the curly braces in this font -- it makes coding more enjoyable.</li><li>Another nice font is Perpetua -- my sister was using this and it really stood out to me.</li><li>I recently switched to the Colemak keyboard layout from Qwerty about a week ago. I've already been using it exclusively for about three days now. The process was somewhat painful, but the ergonomic benefit of this keyboard layout is tangible. What I'm most surprised about is how much my Qwerty got screwed up -- I can't touch type at any reasonable speed on Qwerty anymore, unless I retrain myself to do so.</li><li>While starting to learn Colemak, I simultaneously began to learn Emacs. I'm not sure what kind of effect this has had on learning either, except that I will have no muscle memory for Emacs on Qwerty. Luckily, Emacs does not attempt to have the same kind of ergonomic benefits as ViM (actually, as many people feel discomfort depending so much on the arrow keys, it feels very un-ergonomic) so I don't think there's a huge difference between using one keyboard layout or the other for Emacs. Many of the heavily-used command prefixes (e.g., <code>C-x</code>, <code>C-c</code>, and <code>C-h</code>) are the same on Qwerty and Colemak, so I guess this lessens the learning curve a little bit.</li><li><div>Also while learning Colemak and Emacs, I started using a new (secondhand) keyboard: a Perixx Periboard 512W (W for "white") keyboard. It turns out it doesn't feel very different than the keyboard I was previously using, a Dell SK-8115. Both have a decent keypress and are somewhat clacky. The 512W is a little quieter, and the feel of the keypress for the keys feels really nice, especially the Enter and Backspace keys. They are both standard rubber-dome keyboards and feel sturdy. I'm expecting great things from this keyboard, but my typing speed is currently crippled from the layout switch.</div><a href="/res/posts/13_periboard.jpg" target="_blank" title="click to open in new tab"><img src="/res/posts/13_periboard.jpg" alt="The new keyboard!" style="max-width:100%;"></a><div>The whole story: Until recently, my favorite keyboards are those with a light and shallow keypress like those in many laptops. My hands don't get fatigued as easily and it doesn't bother your ears. Usually I don't like keyboards with a deep keypress because they remind me of the old, loud, early-2000's models that take much force to push and aren't tactile at all. However, typing on the 8115 changed my mind, because it is pretty tactile and it feels like it gives more feedback for effective touch-typing than a laptop keyboard. Even though it takes more force to push than my laptop keyboard and I can get faster typing spurts out on my laptop keyboard, I was able to break my typing record on MonkeyType pretty quickly on the 8115. Despite this, I feel like it is raised up pretty high and my wrist bends backwards uncomfortably if I rest arms on the desk. I looked for wrist rests, but the highly-rated ones were expensive enough that I considered getting a cheap new ergonomic keyboard. The Periboard was rated fairly well for a ~$40 keyboard<sup id="footnote-2-indicator"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>, so I went and got it.</div></li><li>Racing speeds on Colemak so far: improving every day so far! But maybe not for long, progress is definitely slowing. Plot taken from the TypeRacer Discord bot.</li><a href="/res/posts/13_colemak_imp_time.png" target="_blank" title="click to open in new tab"><img src="/res/posts/13_colemak_imp_time.png" alt="Improvement over time on Colemak for the past week." style="max-width:100%;"></a><li>The backspace key was the only thing<sup id="footnote-3-indicator"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> that was broken on my laptop when I bought my laptop secondhand. Not that I ever use Caps Lock in Qwerty, but it's mapped as a second Backspace in Colemak. Luckily, it works on the 512W.</li><li>Some of my passwords are done by muscle memory, but now they are very much not. But I'm considering changing my passwords to make sense in Colemak, so they seem more random on Qwerty.</li><li>The other keyboard layouts I've flirted with before are Dvorak, Dvorak left-handed (Dvorak LH), and <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Colemak mod-DH</a>. Dvorak has its (somewhat dubious) claims to fame, and it feels somewhat intuitive to me, somehow; but I never tried learning it as intensely as Colemak. Colemak is a more modern layout with more concrete design choices and a handful of seriously fast typers, at least -- I don't think Dvorak has that. Dvorak LH is interesting to me because dual-wielding keyboards is high on my list of useless desirable skills. I tried learning Colemak mod-DH first because it's supposed to be more ergonomic by moving the commonly-used D and H keys into a more comfortable position (the <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/curl.html">curl design principle</a>, which is closely related to and works in conjunction with the <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html">angle mod</a>) and it's supported in the default list of keyboards in Arch Linux. However, it's not supported by default in Debian and Android, so I scrapped it and went with standard Colemak. Standard Colemak is also closer to Qwerty, and without curl the bottom-left Z through B keys are all the same (actually, all the keys in the bottom row are the same as Qwerty except for the N key), which was nice because Emacs makes such heavy use of those bottom-left keys. Out of these alternative layouts, I've spent the longest with Dvorak LH and was able to get my speed up to around 50wpm (but this took a long time!).</li></ul><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><p id="footnote-1"><small><a href="#footnote-1-indicator">1.</a> Not websites though, web fonts serve their purpose well</small></p><p id="footnote-2"><small><a href="#footnote-2-indicator">2.</a> Except for its arrow keys.
