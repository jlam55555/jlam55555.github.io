</style><p>These are notes spawned off of reading <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>. I've been following along with the exercises, and my work can be found <a href="https://github.com/jlam55555/sicp">here</a>. More of these posts may follow.</p><hr><p>Here is a really interesting exercise:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-14.html">SICP Exercise 2.6</a>:</p><p>In case representing pairs as procedures wasn't mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a language that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers (at least insofar as nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the operation of adding 1 as</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))]

(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))
</code></pre><p>This representation is known as Church numerals, after its inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who invented the  calculus.</p><p>Define <code>one</code> and <code>two</code> directly (not in terms of <code>zero</code> and <code>add-1</code>). (Hint: Use substitution to evaluate <code>(add-1 zero)</code>). Give a direct definition of the addition procedure + (not in terms of repeated application of <code>add-1</code>).</p></blockquote><p>Firstly, here are some function composition primitives (from section 1.3 exercises). Their functionality should be fairly clear by inspection, and their relevance will soon be apparent.</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define (identity x)
  ;; identity function
  x)

(define (double f)
  ;; composes a function with itself
  (lambda (x)
    (f (f x))))

(define (compose f g)
  ;; returns the composition (f o g)
  (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (n-fold-compose f n)
  ;; generalized version of double: returns the function
  ;; obtained by composing f with itself n times. Assumes n>=0
  (if [zero? n]
      identity
      (let iter ([n n])
	(if [= n 1]
	    f
	    (compose f (iter (1- n)))))))
</code></pre><p>Secondly, I like to annotate and namespace the examples from the book.</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define church-zero
  ;; Church numeral implementation of 0
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x) x)))

(define (church-1+ n)
  ;; Church numeral implementation of 1+
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      (f ((n f) x)))))
</code></pre><p><code>zero</code> is a procedure that always returns the identity function, so it is the same as writing:</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define (church-zero f) identity)</code></pre><p>We immediately see that each "number" is a mapping into the space of procedures. We also see (from the definition of <code>church-1+</code>) that the domain of this mapping is necessarily also a procedure. I.e., each Church numeral is a mapping from functions to functions.<sup id="footnote-1-indicator"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p><p>The implementation of 1 in this function space is derived from the definitions of <code>church-zero</code> and <code>church-1+</code>.</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define (church-one f)
  (lambda (x)
    (f x)))
;;; simplify:
(define (church-one f) f)
;;; simplify:
(define church-one identity)
</code></pre><p>We can apply the same method to derive <code>church-two</code>, the implementation of 2 in this representation:</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define church-two
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      (f (f x)))))
;;; simplify:
(define (church-two f)
  (lambda (x)
    (f (f x))))
;;; simplify:
(define church-two double)
</code></pre><p>From this, the pattern starts to become clear: the Church numeral representation of a nonnegative integer <em>n</em> is the <em>n</em>-fold function composition operator.</p><p>The question asks us to write an explicit procedure for the sum of two Church numerals <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. With the pattern above, we expect this to return the (<em>a</em>+<em>b</em>)-fold composition operator.</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define (church-add a b)
  ;; add two Church numerals
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      ((a f) ((b f) x)))))
</code></pre><p>Similarly, we can define a multiplication in this scheme, which returns the <em>ab</em>-fold composition operator.</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define (church-multiply a b)
  ;; multiply two Church numerals
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (x)
      ((a (b f)) x))))
</code></pre><p>At this point, we've defined a bijection between the nonnegative integers and the Church numerals.<sup id="footnote-2-indicator"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup></p><p>Then we can write functions that convert each nonnegative integer to its (unique) Church numeral representation and vice versa. For the forward direction, we perform <em>n</em>-fold composition on a function. For the backwards direction, we see how many times the Church numeral composes the <code>1+</code> function with itself, which very naturally reveals the corresponding integer.</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">(define (fx->church n)
  ;; nonnegative integer to corresponding Church numeral
  (lambda (f)
    (n-fold-compose f n)))

(define (church->fx n)
  ;; Church numeral to corresponding integer
  ((n 1+) 0))
</code></pre><p>We can do a quick check to see that these work:</p><pre><code class="fancy-code language-scheme">> (map church->fx (list church-zero church-one church-two))
(0 1 2)
> (church->fx (fx->church 512))
512
</code></pre><p>As the name suggests, the Church numerals were invented by Alonzo Church, founder of lambda calculus and pioneer of computability theory, as a theoretical way to encode any data in the form of the primitives of lambda calculus: functions. Even without knowing lambda calculus notation, the Church numeral arithmetic in lambda calculus notation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding">the Wikipedia page for Church encoding</a> are clearly equivalent to my Scheme definitions:</p><a href="/res/posts/14_church_lambda.png" target="_blank" title="click to open in new tab"><img src="/res/posts/14_church_lambda.png" alt="Church numeral arithmetic in lambda calculus notation" style="max-width:100%;"></a><p>Of course, Lisp was heavily influenced by lambda calculus, so this is hardly surprising. But I still find it very cool!</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><p id="footnote-1"><small><a href="#footnote-1-indicator">1.</a> The terms mapping, procedure, and function are used interchangeably here. The first is used in math, the second in SICP, and the third in the general programming sense.</small></p><p id="footnote-2"><small><a href="#footnote-2-indicator">2.</a> I recently finished my first Algebra class, so I want to elaborate a little. The nonnegative integers form a semiring (a ri<em>n</em>g without <em>n</em>egatives, i.e., a rig or subring). We define the Church numeral n' to be the n-fold composition operator, and this automatically defines a bijective map g defined by g(n)=n'. Using the definitions of the Church addition and multiplication, and bootstrapping off of the properties of the integers, we can trivially prove two more facts: Church numerals also form a rig, and g is a subring homomorphism (a subring isomorphism.) I'm not sure if these facts are interesting though.</small></p><hr><p>&copy; Copyright 2021 Jonathan Lam</p></body></html>
