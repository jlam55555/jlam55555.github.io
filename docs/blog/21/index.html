I achieved a maximum of 101wpm 10-race average, and finished with a 98wpm 10-race average. I have been gotten at not quitting races prematurely. There was some practice on Keybr.com, MonkeyType.com, and Typing.com, but not much.</p><a href="/res/posts/21_jlam55555colemak_1000.png" target="_blank" title="click to open in new tab"><img src="/res/posts/21_jlam55555colemak_1000.png" alt="Plot of 1000 races wpm over race #" style="max-width:100%;"></a><a href="/res/posts/21_jlam55555colemak_1000_time.png" target="_blank" title="click to open in new tab"><img src="/res/posts/21_jlam55555colemak_1000_time.png" alt="Plot of 1000 races wpm over time" style="max-width:100%;"></a><p>Some things I've noticed:</p><ul><li>I have completely lost my ability to touch type on Qwerty. I think I'll practice this so I can use other people's keyboards again once I reach a desirable speed on Colemak.</li><li>I only use my left thumb for space, while it seems that a majority of users use their dominant hand thumb (except when gaming (which I don't do) and using the mouse with their dominant hand). (I am right-handed.)</li><li>I can type a little faster on my laptop keyboard than on the Periboard 512 keyboard I bought. The keyboard is smaller and the keypress is lighter, and I am more used to it. (I also don't like loud typing, so this may subconsciously slow me down on the relatively loud Periboard.)</li><li>I've been trying to learn to use Caps Lock for backspace (this is a default Colemak mapping) so that my hands don't move that much when deleting a character. It's gotten somewhat comfortable but the repeat speed is atrocious. Also, I sometimes hit Tab or Shift by accident, which is not desirable. The Caps Lock key on my laptop is broken, however, so I only use regular backspace there.</li><li>I've heard from other typists that they only use one Shift key (mostly left) for all capital letters. I do find this sometimes helpful for all uppercase letters (e.g., I type "TODO" a lot, which is not comfortable to type when switching Shifts), but it is still a little awkward for keys that I would normally press with my left pinky (i.e., capital Q, A, and Z). I'm not sure if I'll stick with alternating Shifts or not.</li><li>I have to look at the keys still when accessing many of the punctuation/number keys, which is not good.</li></ul><hr><p>&copy; Copyright 2023 Jonathan Lam</p></body></html>
